                    <strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU):</strong> The CPU, often referred to as the brain of the computer, executes instructions from programs, performing calculations and managing tasks. It consists of the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), which performs arithmetic and logical operations, and the control unit (CU), which directs the operation of the processor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Memory (RAM):</strong> Random Access Memory (RAM) is the short-term memory of the computer, temporarily storing data and programs that are currently in use for quick access. It is volatile memory, meaning it loses its contents when the computer is powered off.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Storage:</strong> This includes Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and Solid State Drives (SSDs) where data, files, and programs are permanently stored. HDDs use magnetic storage, while SSDs use flash memory, offering faster access speeds and greater durability.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Motherboard:</strong> The main circuit board that houses the CPU, memory, and other essential components, providing connectivity between them. It includes slots for expansion cards (such as graphics cards and network cards), connectors for storage devices, and interfaces for peripheral devices.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Input/Output Devices:</strong> These include peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, monitor, and printer, allowing users to interact with the computer and receive output. Input devices enable users to provide data and commands to the computer, while output devices display or produce the results of the computer's processes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Graphics Processing Unit (GPU):</strong> A specialized processor designed to accelerate graphics rendering. GPUs are essential for tasks such as gaming, video editing, and running applications that require high-performance graphics.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cooling Systems:</strong> These include fans, heat sinks, and liquid cooling solutions that dissipate heat generated by the CPU, GPU, and other components, ensuring optimal operating temperatures and preventing overheating.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Network Interface Card (NIC):</strong> A hardware component that allows computers to connect to a network, enabling communication and data transfer between devices. It can support wired (Ethernet) or wireless (Wi-Fi) connections.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>BIOS/UEFI:</strong> Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) or Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) firmware that initializes and tests hardware components during the boot process and provides a runtime environment for the operating system.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ports and Connectors:</strong> Various interfaces such as USB, HDMI, Ethernet, audio jacks, and power connectors that allow the connection of external devices and peripherals to the computer.
                </li>
            </ul>
