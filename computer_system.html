        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Components of a Computer System</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU):</strong> The CPU, often referred to as the brain of the computer, executes instructions from programs, performing calculations and managing tasks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Memory (RAM):</strong> Random Access Memory (RAM) is the short-term memory of the computer, temporarily storing data and programs that are currently in use for quick access.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Storage:</strong> This includes Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and Solid State Drives (SSDs) where data, files, and programs are permanently stored.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Motherboard:</strong> The main circuit board that houses the CPU, memory, and other essential components, providing connectivity between them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Power Supply:</strong> Converts electrical energy from an outlet into a usable form for the computer's internal components, supplying the necessary power.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Input/Output Devices:</strong> These include peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, monitor, and printer, allowing users to interact with the computer and receive output.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>Functions of a Computer System</h2>
            <p>A computer system performs various functions, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Processing Data:</strong> The computer processes data by executing instructions from software applications to perform specific tasks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Storing Information:</strong> Computers store information in various forms of memory and storage devices, making it available for future use.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Managing Hardware Resources:</strong> The operating system manages hardware resources like the CPU, memory, and storage to ensure efficient operation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Running Applications and Software:</strong> Computers run various applications and software to perform a wide range of tasks, from word processing to gaming.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Networking:</strong> Computers can connect to networks, allowing them to communicate and share data with other devices over local or global networks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>User Interaction:</strong> Computers provide interfaces for users to interact with applications and perform tasks, such as graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and command-line interfaces (CLIs).
